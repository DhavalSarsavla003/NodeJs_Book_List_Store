## 🚀 Overview

This project is a CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) application designed to demonstrate DOM manipulation and modern CSS styling. It uses a **responsive grid layout**, ensuring the interface looks perfect on desktops, tablets, and mobile devices. The visual style relies heavily on CSS `backdrop-filter` to achieve the frosted glass effect.

## ✨ Key Features

* **📱 Fully Responsive:** The layout adapts to different screen sizes, stacking the form and list on smaller devices.
* **🎨 Glassmorphism Design:** A modern UI aesthetic using transparency, blur, and white borders over a dark nature background.
* **📚 Book Management (CRUD):**
    * **Add Books:** Users can input Book Name, Author, Price, and Description.
    * **View List:** Books are displayed in a stylish grid card format.
    * **Detailed View:** Click to see full details of a specific book (as seen in the screenshots).
    * **Delete/Edit:** Functionality to remove or update book entries.
* **🚫 Empty State Handling:** Displays a "No books found.. Please Add Book..." message when the list is empty.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

* **HTML5:** Semantic structure of the application.
* **CSS3:** Flexbox & CSS Grid for layout, plus advanced styling for the glass effect.
* **JavaScript:** Logic for adding books, handling form submissions, and managing the UI state.

## 🔮 Future Scope

* Add LocalStorage support to save books permanently.
* Implement a search bar to filter books by name or author.
* Add image upload functionality for book covers.
